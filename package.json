  "description": "This library installs new custom procedures for blockly, with custom modifications: - The parameters now can be easily added and removed with buttons, replacing the mutator popup. - The arguments (`variables_get`) are associated with the procedure. All this blocks now have a `$parent` field with the id of the procedure where they belong. **For this to work, you must save this `$parent` in the mutation of `variables_get`**. - The 'help' option was removed from the context menu. - The block `procedures_defnoreturn` has been splitted in `procedures_defnoreturn` and `procedures_defnoreturnnoparams`. - The block `procedures_defreturn` has been splitted in `procedures_defreturn`, `procedures_defreturnsimplewithparams` and `procedures_defreturnsimple`. - The blocks can be added on every category you want. If you want to create a category for the calls, use the custom names `PROCEDURE_CALLS` and `FUNCTION_CALLS`. - Procedure descriptions are disabled by default.",
